Gazing up at the night sky, one can't help but marvel at the vast expanse of the universe. Stars twinkle like diamonds scattered across a velvet cloth, each one a sun in its own right, perhaps with planets of its own. The constellations tell ancient stories, guiding explorers and inspiring poets. In the quiet of the night, the sky reminds us of our place in the cosmos, offering a perspective that is both humbling and exhilarating.
