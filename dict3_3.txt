Science, in its essence, is not just a collection of facts but a method of understanding the world. It is a discipline that values skepticism and inquiry, relying on empirical evidence to unravel the mysteries of the universe. The philosophy of science delves into the principles underlying scientific investigation, examining the frameworks through which we interpret findings. It challenges us to question the nature of knowledge itself, exploring the boundaries between scientific theories and the reality they seek to explain.
